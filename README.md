# VMware to OpenShift Virtualization  
**A Practical, Low-Risk Migration Guide**

## Purpose

This repository exists to make the transition from VMware-based virtualization to OpenShift Virtualization understandable, testable, and low-risk.

Many organizations are evaluating alternatives to traditional virtualization platforms due to licensing changes, cost pressure, and long-term platform strategy. At the same time, there is understandable concern about operational risk, skill gaps, and business continuity.

This project is designed to reduce that fear.

It focuses on:
- Clear comparisons, not marketing
- Small, reversible experiments
- Operational equivalence
- Hands-on validation over assumptions

No prior Kubernetes expertise is assumed.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

### This repository **is**:
- A translation layer for VMware practitioners
- A feature and concept comparison between platforms
- A set of guided exercises to migrate virtual machines safely
- A practical reference for architects, operators, and decision-makers

### This repository **is not**:
- A sales pitch
- A “lift everything at once” migration plan
- A replacement for vendor documentation
- A promise that every workload should move

The goal is confidence through understanding — not forced change.
